</p>

Gufo is a vertical local inference engine specifically built and optimized for the AMD Strix Halo hardware:
Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 systems with Radeon 8060S (`gfx1151`), up to 128 GiB of unified memory.

**Contributions are welcome!**

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gufo-org/gufo/releases)
for user-facing changes and release history.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository provides native Windows 11 x64 support (`gfx1151`) with AMD TheRock ROCm, fully updated with all upstream Gufo features and major enhancements from [dardeaw/MBufo](https://github.com/dardeaw/MBufo) and [endyjasmi/gufo](https://github.com/endyjasmi/gufo), featuring a complete llama.cpp-style Gufo Chat Web UI with SQLite persistence, sandboxed per-user workspaces, KV cache quantization, interactive model inquiries, and 1-click release publishing.

## 🚀 Latest Updates in This Fork

### 🔒 Per-User Sandboxed `UserData/` & File Explorer
- **Isolated User Directories**: Each user is assigned their own isolated folder: `UserData/{user_id}_{username}/`.
- **Zero-Leak Sandboxing**: Strict filesystem boundaries enforced in C++ backend (`weakly_canonical` relative path resolution). Users are forbidden from viewing, browsing, reading, writing, or executing tools in other user directories or external computer drives.
- **Sandboxed File Explorer**: Dedicated file explorer in the sidebar (`📁 Files`) allowing users to navigate subfolders, view file sizes, preview images/documents (`👁️`), delete files, and manage their conversation artifacts.

### 🛡️ Tool Permission Control & Interactive Model Inquiries
- **Ask Before Running vs. Allow All**: Interactive toggle in the attachment menu and settings to require human approval (`[✓ Approve & Run]` / `[✕ Deny]`) before tool execution or allow autonomous agentic flow.
- **Model Clarification Feature (`ask_user`)**: The model can invoke the built-in `ask_user` tool when it needs clarification or missing parameters. The UI renders an interactive card with selectable option buttons and a text input field, pausing generation until the user responds.

### 🎨 New Chat Interactive Landing View & 7-Item Attachment Menu
- **Empty Window Action Cards**: When opening a new chat, the empty main viewport presents an interactive hero card grid with direct access to Attach Images, Attach Files, Working Directory, File Explorer, Tools & MCP, Tool Permission, Thinking Level, and Context presets.
- **Attachment Popup Menu** (Paperclip icon in chat input):
  1. **Attach Images**: Add multimodal vision attachments.
  2. **Attach Files**: Attach source code, logs, and text context.
  3. **Working Directory**: Per-chat working directory inside user's sandbox (`UserData/{user_id}_{username}/{conv_id} - {title}`).
  4. **Tools & MCP Master Switch & Groups**: Enable/disable all tools or toggle individual tool groups (Filesystem, Code Inspection, Shell, Web, MCP/Custom).
  5. **System Prompt Presets**: Select from Default, Coder, Concise, Reasoner, Creative, or create custom presets.
  6. **6 Thinking Levels**: Quick selection of `auto`, `minimum` (512 budget), `low` (2048 budget), `medium` (4096 budget), `high` (8192 budget), and `xhigh` (16384 budget).
  7. **Context Usage & Compaction**: Live token meter for 262k context with 1-click history compaction (`🧹 Compact`).
- **Cleaned Navigation**: Removed redundant "Tools & MCP" button from the top header since the Settings drawer already manages tools.

### ⚡ KV Cache Quantization & UD-IQ4_XS Support (VRAM/RAM Optimization)
- **KV Cache Quantization for Qwen 3.8 Flash-Next**: Referencing optimizations from [dardeaw/MBufo](https://github.com/dardeaw/MBufo) and [endyjasmi/gufo](https://github.com/endyjasmi/gufo), Gufo supports:
  - `--kv-quant f16`: Standard 16-bit float KV cache.
  - `--kv-quant q8`: 8-bit quantized KV cache (~50% memory reduction).
  - `--kv-quant fp8`: 8-bit floating point KV cache for fast tensor cores.
  - `GUFO_KV_V4=1` (K8V4 / K4V4): 4-bit / 8-bit compressed KV cache, reducing 262k context KV memory footprint from ~64 GiB down to under 16 GiB!
- **Unsloth `UD-IQ4_XS` Support**: Full support for Unsloth's ultra-compact `UD-IQ4_XS` quantized weights alongside `UD-Q4_K_XL` and `UD-Q8_K_XL`, minimizing VRAM and system memory bandwidth contention.
- **Quantization-Aware Memory Estimation**: `inventory.ps1` and `launcher.ps1` automatically compute KV cache memory requirements based on selected quantization and total context.

### 📦 1-Click GitHub Release Publish
- **Double-Clickable `publish_release.cmd`**: One-click publishing that packages the Windows distribution with all DLLs and ROCm dependencies, generates comprehensive release notes, tags the release with `version.txt` (currently `v0.18.0`), and uploads to GitHub via `gh release create`.
- **PowerShell Script**: `tools\windows\publish_release.ps1` for automated CI/CD and scripted release pipelines.

Peak measured workloads; text pp is autoregressive (AR), while tg uses the
named speculative mode. Peaks include repetitive output; aggregate tg sums
individual request decode rates. Qwen27B's single-user peak uses the short-prompt
C1 workload. Audio excludes loading.
Each model guide lists the required files and complete benchmark settings.

## Philosophy

- Contributions are welcome! We need the help of Strix Halo community to keep improving gufo!
- We would like this to be the one-stop shop for Strix Halo Local AI enthusiasts: batteries included for text, audio, image, and video models.
- Build and optimize specifically for the Strix Halo 128 GiB hardware. Smaller memory configurations should still work and preserve the speed benefits for models that can fit on memory.
- Support only the best available models for their size that can run on this hardware: less code to maintain, more focused optimization and testing work.
- Preserve quality when optimizing. Each model's quality report records independent numerical checks, execution consistency and unresolved gaps. Don't reuse kernels across different models to limit blast radius of a code change.
- Treat concurrent requests, cancellation and conversation caching as first-class workloads.
- Keep production dependencies small and development tools separate.

## Quickstart

### Windows (Native, gfx1151)

1. Check prerequisites and system configuration:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\windows\check.ps1
   ```
2. Build Gufo natively:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\windows\build.ps1
   ```
3. Run the interactive launcher (auto-detects models, drafts, vision sidecars, and optimal context):
   ```cmd
   start.cmd
   ```
   Or launch directly via CLI:
   ```powershell
   .\build\release\gufo.exe serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 llm --model "C:\path\to\model.gguf"
   ```

### Linux (Container / Podman)

```sh
hf download unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF \

```

Rootless Podman needs `crun` for `--group-add keep-groups`. Your host user must
have read/write access to `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri/renderD*`, usually through the
`render` and `video` groups; log out and back in after changing membership.
Container groups named `video`/`render` do not preserve host supplementary
groups. Check `id`, `ls -l /dev/kfd /dev/dri/renderD*`, and
`podman info --format '{{.Host.OCIRuntime.Name}}'` if ROCm reports no device.
See [Podman's rootless group-access guidance](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md#20-passed-in-devices-or-files-cant-be-accessed-in-rootless-container).

On Fedora or another SELinux-enforcing host, GPU enumeration can succeed while
SELinux blocks mapping `/dev/kfd`, causing ROCr to report a misleading
“Memory critical” error. Check the **host** audit log:

```sh
sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent | grep -E '/dev/kfd|hsa_device_t'
```

If it shows a denied `map` for the container, Podman documents this fix:

```sh
sudo setsebool -P container_use_devices true
```

This persistently allows containers to access device labels for devices passed
into them; it affects all containers on that host. Review that policy scope
before enabling it. See [Podman's device documentation](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#device-host-device-container-device-permissions)
and the [SELinux container policy](https://github.com/containers/container-selinux/blob/main/container.te).

Then, from another terminal, ask it something through the OpenAI-compatible API:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q8_K_XL",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say something"}]
  }'
```

For Open WebUI, VS Code, OpenAI SDK and Responses-API clients (for example
Codex), set the API base URL to `http://localhost:8080/v1`. Chat Completions and
Responses support text, images, function tools, structured output and streaming.
See the [API contract](docs/SERVER.md).

The text server uses the model's native context by default and generates until
EOS or the context is full. `--context N` sets context capacity per session;
`--max-tokens N` sets a default response limit that clients can override.
Reasoning tokens count toward that response limit.

## Harness notes

- **Qwen with Codex:** Codex sends developer messages mid-conversation, after
  compaction or a settings change. Qwen's template accepts only one leading
  system turn, so Gufo moves them there. The request that introduces one is
  prefilled again; later requests reuse the cache. See the
  [API contract](docs/SERVER.md).

## Build from source

AMD Strix Halo (`gfx1151`) is supported natively on both **Windows 11 x64** and **Linux x86-64**.

### Windows 11 x64 (Native)

Windows 11 x64 builds natively against AMD's TheRock ROCm 10.0.0 and Visual Studio C++ Build Tools (MSVC STL + Windows SDK) without WSL.

| Piece | Default location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TheRock ROCm 10.0.0 (Windows, gfx1151) | `C:\TheRock\build` | Extracted from AMD TheRock distribution tarball |
| vcpkg | `C:\vcpkg` | `vcpkg install icu curl openssl libpng libjpeg-turbo --triplet x64-windows` |
| Visual Studio Build Tools | Any | "Desktop development with C++" |
| CMake 3.21+ & Ninja | `PATH` or `C:\tools\ninja` | |

```powershell
# 1. Inspect setup and verify prerequisites
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\windows\check.ps1

# 2. Build release (produces build\release\gufo.exe and copies required DLLs)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\windows\build.ps1

# 3. Diagnose GPU status
.\build\release\gufo.exe diagnose
```

See [Windows documentation](docs/WINDOWS.md) for full toolchain details, test suites, and packaging scripts.

### Linux (With Nix)

```sh
nix build
./result/bin/gufo diagnose
./result/bin/gufo serve llm --model /path/to/model.gguf
```

[flake.lock](flake.lock) pins the dependencies. `nix develop` adds profiling,
model-download and independent evaluation tools; these are not runtime
requirements. Optional benchmark baselines are selected separately with
`nix shell .#ds4-reference`, `.#llama-cpp-reference` or
`.#llama-cpp-mtp-reference`; see [benchmarking](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).
See [testing](docs/TESTING.md) for the small hosted CI suite and
explicit local quality checks.

The Nix package and development shell include a ROCr 7.2.3
[queue-memory patch](.devops/nix/patches/rocr-fixed-cwsr.patch) for Strix Halo.
It keeps queue save/restore buffers, launch/copy arenas and code-loading
staging resident during host memory compaction, while retaining managed-memory
support and the ordinary fine-grained host-allocation policy.

### Without Nix

Install a C++20 compiler, CMake 3.21+, Ninja, pkg-config and the
following development libraries. The currently qualified toolchain is GCC
15.3 and ROCm 7.2.3. Attention and audio convolution kernels are compiled
directly from HIP. Python, Triton/AOTriton, Composable Kernel and MIOpen are
not production build or runtime requirements.
For the same protection against queue evictions as the Nix build, apply the
ROCr patch above when building your runtime. Flash-Next's host buffers also use
Linux long-term pins, with ordinary HIP registration retained when system
limits disallow those pins. Gufo leaves `HSA_USERPTR_FOR_PAGED_MEM` unchanged.

| Dependency | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| ROCm HIP compiler/runtime, hipBLAS, hipBLASLt, rocBLAS | GPU execution and matrix multiplication |
| hipCUB, rocPRIM, rocWMMA headers | Compiled GPU kernels |
| ICU, libcurl, OpenSSL, libpng, libjpeg, libwebp | Tokenization, HTTPS, hashing and images |
| FFmpeg and ffprobe | Video/audio output; invoked as separate executables |

Install ROCm using [AMD's Linux instructions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/).
Use the development packages for the libraries above. ROCm normally installs
under `/opt/rocm`.

For example, on Debian/Ubuntu the ordinary system libraries are:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  libicu-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libwebp-dev ffmpeg

# ROCm libraries from the table, named as AMD's repository ships them.
sudo apt install hipblas-dev hipblaslt-dev rocblas-dev \
  hipcub-dev rocprim-dev rocwmma-dev

cmake --preset release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build --preset release --parallel 4
./build/release/gufo diagnose
./build/release/gufo serve llm --model /path/to/model.gguf
```

Configuring fails at `find_package(hipblas)` when those ROCm packages are
missing. Other distributions name them `-devel` instead of `-dev`.
For nonstandard installations, pass ordinary CMake paths, for example
`cmake --preset release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/rocm"`.
If compiler discovery picks a system Clang, also pass
`-DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++`.
Use `cmake --install build/release` to install Gufo,
its runtime data and license notices. The GPU driver must allow your user to
access `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri`; model weights are acquired separately.

The same source, compiler flags and install rules serve both builds. Nix pins
the complete toolchain for reproducible comparisons; changing the compiler or
math libraries requires the affected model's quality checks.
